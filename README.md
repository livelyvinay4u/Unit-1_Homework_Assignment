Issue with not having such a centralized online toolkit, would mean financial firms will be required to manually perform these checks and be informed of any regulatory and compliance obligations.

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

In the segment with very targeted service offering, bronID has been playing s

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? 

Key success indicators used by companies in this domain to measure their progress and success are:
1.	In built AI capability
2.	Automation of compliance and oversight processes
3.	Tech agility i.e. use of cloud, API’s for delivery methods, predictive analytics, Machine Learning
4.	Evidence based and data driven approach
5.	Open-source customer base i.e. not restricted to financial institution, rather covers non-financial clients too. 
6.	Cost of operation
7.	Funding and investments cycles and amount raised
8.	Age, turnover and headcount

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?



## Recommendations: 

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 

bronID provides Compliance as a Service (CaaS) advisory along the lines of AML/CTF, as one of the service offerings. Because Compliance is a very broad and complex topic to know, understand and be updated with, bronID should focus on widening their advisory scope to not be limited to AML/CTF only. Rather must expand to data standardization, materiality, governance, risk and controls/risk reduction measures and some sort of in-built intelligence. So basically, start working on delivery Compliance as a Service as a full package which customer can review and select per need. Having just limited compliance service offering would limit the customer base and hence impact their growth. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? 

Expanding the scope of their Compliance as a Service offering to include data, materiality, governance and risk would allow potential new and existing customers opt for a bundle option, which would less of vendor management for them and can potentially get better price. Benefit to bronID would be increase in customer base and an opportunity to improve their service as part of customer feedback loop. Working together with customers bronID could show benefits in terms how automation of Compliance would help them move away from mundane compliance tasks and educe operational risks (associated with meeting compliance and reporting obligations)

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? 

As a starting point, they would be required to know, develop and build on their country compliance and regulatory requirements and guidelines like GDPR, data privacy and regulations. So, they would be required to develop a trust portal that enable customers to self-serve basing their requirements and how bronID will help to meet them:
a.	Legislation/regulation gap analysis
b.	Compliance universe tools
c.	Regulatory reporting
d.	Risk data warehouse

Technology requirements can be broken into following high level stages:
1.	Cognitive technologies like Data science & Analytics tools and existing source platforms (that hold Regulatory related information etc.) around collation of regulatory and compliance requirements, what best practices and standards are followed for information and security data processing. Possible tools that can be used – Hadoop, Tableau, Pentaho, as these tools provide bespoke reporting capability 
2.	Web technologies for development of the Trust portal. Possible options could be explored are cloud-based platform (SaaS) managed by team of experts.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Reason these solutions are appropriate are because –
1.	Cost – Cloud based solutions offer pay as you use option which benefits organisation shed cost involved in managing and maintaining the infrastructure to run the platform.
2.	Flexibility & Agility – Evergreen platform and better availability and delivery of service at speed. 
3.	Performance/scalability – ability to easily add or remove service features.
4.	Analytics – Better visualisation capability provided by Tableau, Hadoop, and other big data tools. They provide capability to predict trends and recognise outliners.

bronID has served varying customer base and provided their KYC, ML/TF services to them. These customers range from small to mid-sized organisations primarily. Examples – 180Markets, Qubix, Jaggards, ACE money transfer, AusMerchant and more.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) 

Technology and risk based approach used in the development of the toolkit. Key technologies and process used - API, workflows and nesting. Details below:<br/>
•	Developers tools - RESTful KYC/KYB API (to integrate with bronID platform) to real-time webhooks (to keep systems in sync with the status of the bronID verifications).<br/>
•	Automated workflows - Full-stack KYC/AML automation. Verify your customers, assess their IDV risk and automatically document the procedure - all of these processes executed in one API call.<br/>
•	Other web services including HTML5, jQuery and Google Fonts<br/> 
•	Fast iterations - Release new features and improvements every month.<br/>
•	Cross-organisational management - Nested bronID accounts for AML/CTF management across linked organisations to a reporting entity.<br/>
